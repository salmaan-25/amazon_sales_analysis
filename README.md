This project analyzes "Amazon e-commerce sales data" using  Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn) and creates
cleaned datasets for building interactive Power BI dashboards.  

The goal is to demonstrate "end-to-end Data Analytics skills":  
data cleaning → analysis → visualization → reporting.

2. After extracting open "analysis.py"  using idle or jupiter or any code editor.
3. Then change the data set name (incase of other dataset) or leave it as it is "amazon.csv".
4. Finally run the code and you would get the csv files(analyzed) generated inside the "data" folder.
5. After that open PowerBI and you can import those csv and create interactive dashboards or else you can use those dashboards that i have given.
